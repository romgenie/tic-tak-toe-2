# Ablations

Add flags such as --canonical-only and --no-augmentation to study the impact of symmetry handling.

Recommended comparisons:

- canonical_only vs full + augmentation on dataset size and policy distributions
- normalize_to_move on/off for feature compactness

Write results into metrics.csv and reference them here.
